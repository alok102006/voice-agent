primary concerns manifest in english and in some degree australian case law have been to maintain the effectiveness of particular police functions and to avert their compromise or undermining by the imposition of a duty to an individual over and above that owed to the public in english law this has led to the adoption of an exclusionary principle which is often cast in broad terms,CRIMINAL
i will return below to whether such an exclusionary principle based on public policy accurately reflects the law in this country see thompson v vincent at or whether the principle does no more than represent the usual or predictable but not invariable consequence of the evaluation of whether the relationship between the police and an individual in a given instance imports a duty of care in the context of a police investigation cf graham barclay oysters pty ltd v ryan hca clr at before so doing it is important to emphasise that police officers are not as such and in all circumstances immune from the law of negligence for acts or omissions in the course of official duty that occasion foreseeable harm,CRIMINAL

if it were necessary to consider the effect upon native title over the waters of the creek of pastoral leases granted in the claim area i would conclude that such acts of extinguishment would not necessarily be inconsistent with the exercise by indigenous people of their ordinary activities in relation to those waters arnhemland aboriginal land trust v director of fisheries alr the same would be true of any supposed inconsistency between a public right to fish and a nonexclusive native title right to do so,PROPERTY

it seems clear that at the heart of native title lie principles of descent professor peter butt whose text land law provides a helpful overview of this area comments at footnote where traditional descent rules can no longer operate for example through diminution of the primary native titleholding group neighbouring or related groups may operate as custodians for the area until the proper line of descent can be reestablished or until they assume primary responsibility for the area themselves see generally re waanyi peoples native title application alr at wandarang alawa marra and ngalakan peoples v northern territory fca fcr at de rose v south australia fcafc fcr at,PROPERTY

the northern territory also relied upon the following passage from gumana his honours reasoning on this topic firstly recognised that the prerogative rights of the crown with respect to the foreshore were subject to the separate common law rights of the public to fish and to navigate in the water above that land and to the arms of the sea the next step was to reach the provisional view that the public rights to fish and to navigate in the foreshore and in the rivers and estuaries of blue mud bay were abrogated by the land grants under the land rights act,PROPERTY

bavaria nv emphasises s of the act requires not only that the connotation of the trade mark be established but also that because of the connotation the use of the trade mark in relation to the goods will be likely to deceive or cause confusion the likelihood of deception or confusion must flow from the secondary meaning inherent in the mark itself alr at per gyles j,PROPERTY
normal and fair use of the mark may affect and reflect the way in which the consumer evaluates the prominence of the features of the trade mark in circumstances where bavaria nvs beer has been marketed by reference to bavaria bavaria beer and bavaria holland and it is by those names that the beer may be known it is appropriate in considering whether the mark is inherently adapted to distinguish bavaria nvs goods also to take into account that use of the trade mark fcr at citing de cordova v vick chemical co rpc at,PROPERTY

fourth although mr spry for ms jones urged that the contract of employment should be interpreted as implying a term requiring qtac to accord natural justice to ms jones in connection with any determination of serious misconduct or misconduct by ms jones such an implied term is difficult to reconcile with cl which specifically provides that qtac is not required to follow grievance or other procedures in view of the seniority of ms jones position the court does not lightly imply terms into a contract which the parties have not thought fit to express,EMPLOYMENT
is clear from the decision of the high court in byrne v australian airlines ltd hca clr that the same considerations apply in respect of the implication of terms into contracts of employment,EMPLOYMENT
light of the detailed terms of cl which provides for different grounds of termination and associated periods of notice and a specific provision in cl excluding review procedures in respect of ms jones employment it is difficult to see how the implication of term importing the rules of natural justice into the terms and conditions of employment can be justified on any of the conditions described in bp refinery clr certainly there is clear authority to the contrary the house of lords held in malloch v aberdeen corporation wlr that absent statutory intervention there is no rule at common law that the requirements of natural justice are incorporated into the employment relationship,EMPLOYMENT

note that a contrary view was expressed by ryan j in police federation of australia v nixon fca fcr where his honour observed that the resumption of an investigation into certain allegations against a senior police officer did not amount to an alteration of the officers position because alteration in this context requires a substantive change in or reduction of the advantages enjoyed by the employee in that capacity specifically his honour found that merely to be subject to a disciplinary inquiry or investigation does not without more constitute such a substantive change,EMPLOYMENT
in a case in which the tribunal found without making any investigation that newspaper articles were not genuine and that parts of the applicant for reviews story were implausible a full court of this court held that the tribunal had made a jurisdictional error by failing to conduct its review in accordance with the fair procedure required by the act what is even more extraordinary about the deficiency in the reasoning process in the case before me is that the second newspaper article appeared while the appellant was in australia on june during the hearing reinforcing the fact that the jirga was actively engaged in persecuting the appellant and his family,FAMILY

justice mchugh made the same observation in newcastle city council v gio general ltd hca clr at in applying a purposive construction the function of the court remains one of construction and not legislation when the express words of a legislative provision are reasonably capable of only one construction and neither the purpose of the provision nor any other provision in the legislation throws doubt on that construction a court cannot ignore it and substitute a different construction because it furthers the objects of the legislation,PROPERTY
the relevant principles in relation to the formation of a contract are conveniently summarised by kaye j in his leading judgment in australian and new zealand banking group ltd v frost holdings pty ltd vr at as follows it is a first principle of the law of contracts that there can be no binding and enforceable obligation unless the terms of the bargain or at least its essential or critical terms have been agreed upon so there is no concluded contract where an essential or critical term is expressly left to be settled by future agreement of the parties per sugarman j,PROPERTY

the presumption of a resulting trust that arises when property is transferred without consideration into the name of a person who is neither the child adopted child or wife of the transferor does no more than call for proof of an intention to confer beneficial ownership prima facie there is a resulting trust but where satisfactory proof is forthcoming that a purpose of the transaction was to confer beneficial ownership the presumption is rebutted hca clr the case of an aunt who put money into a joint bank account in her name and that of her nephew on the basis that it would be held in trust for the aunt during her lifetime but thereafter the beneficial interest would pass to the nephew,FAMILY

the next segment of written submissions of cao may be summarised to the effect that there is no evidence which established that either of the applicants perceived himself to have been in a contractual relationship with cao for the following reasons the applicants did not assert in evidence that they were employed by cao during the course of their encounter with cao the applicants did not describe themselves in their respective applications to mes for employment in november as having been previously employed by cao but rather as each having been a contractor at the hvo with the contracting company i refer in that regard to their respective job application forms for permanent employment with cao at the hvo appearing at pp and of exhibit the applicants did not describe themselves in their respective curriculum vitae as having been employed by cao but referred merely to their employment history in the case of mr wilton as mining earth moving services and in the case of mr cumberland as plant operator mining earthmoving services muswellbrook mr wilton did not describe himself in his taxation returns as having been employed by cao but he identified mes as the payer of his salary and wages in each of the years to in relation to that documentary material it was pointed out by cao that regard may be paid to subsequent conduct in order to ascertain whether a contract had or still existed just as it is permissible to have regard to subsequent conduct in order to determine whether an intention to contract existed nswlr at gleeson cj with whose reasons hope and mahoney jja agreed and damevski at and,EMPLOYMENT

the applicants drew attention to what was said to be the correct legal position located within paras and of the reasons for judgment of mummery lj in dacas v brook street bureau ltd irlr brook street was a united kingdom court of appeal decision the context whereof related to labour hire arrangements between brook street bureau uk ltd a well known employment agency and a local councils mental health hostel for the periodic cleaning thereof which in the events that happened were physically undertaken at material times by the applicant mrs dacas,EMPLOYMENT
reference may also be made to building workers industrial union of australia v odco pty ltd fcr where the context was that the respondent carried on business of supplying labour by way of hire to builders construction managers and contractors in the building industry and the issue arose whether workers thus sent to building sites by the respondent were the respondents employees or the employees of the builder a full federal court found that no contract of employment however characterised had been made between the worker and the builder to whom his labour was supplied because the element of consideration essential to a contract of employment being the promise by the presumptive employer to pay for services as and where rendered was absent in that case,EMPLOYMENT
i should add in any event that the applicants drew attention to what appears in the joint reasons for judgment of brennan cj dawson and toohey jj in byrne v australian airlines limited hca clr at as follows a right to the payment of award rates is imported by statute into the employment relationship which is contractual in origin and express promise apart it is only in that sense that it can be said that award rates are imported into the contract of employment in a system of industrial regulation where some but not all of the incidents of an employment relationship are determined by award it is plainly unnecessary that the contract of employment should provide for those matters already covered by the award,EMPLOYMENT
the applicants next drew attention to the decision of the united kingdom court of appeal in cable amp wireless plc v muscat irlr handed down subsequently to brook street where it was found by majority that a labour hire worker was employed by the host rather than by the agency through which the host had directed that he be engaged whilst the applicants acknowledged the facts in cable and wireless were distinguishable from brook street the applicants placed reliance upon the acknowledgment by the court of appeal in cable amp wireless upon the majoritys views in brook street which they submitted to be seemingly to the effect that so long as remuneration is being provided in reality by the employer it matters not that it is not paid directly by that employer but by a third party pursuant to another arrangement made by the employer with that third party,EMPLOYMENT

the applicants emphasised in the course of submissions that the present case did not involve the need for the court to focus on all of the persons engaged by cao on its mine site in the hunter valley whether through contractors inclusive of mes but rather must address the circumstances of the applicants in their interaction with and otherwise in relation to cao i was referred to the earlier case of dalgety farmers ltd tas grazcos v bruce nswccr at where kirby acj with whom the other members of the new south wales court of appeal agreed observed generally in relation to an issue as to tortious liability of an employer determining whether employment exists and if so with which person or organisation is often a difficult task,EMPLOYMENT
the applicants cited extensively from the full federal court judgments in damevski v giudice and others fcafc fcr where the unanimous conclusion of marshall wilcox and merkel jj was to the effect that the purported restructure of a cleaning operation from that of former employees to their ongoing provision of cleaning services as contractors but nevertheless still engaged by their former employer as a principal to the ongoing controversial relationship did not operate to terminate the preexisting contracts of employment for the purpose of the operation of the wr act no change having occurred in any physical sense to the work activities of the purported contractors from what had previously been undertaken by them as employees i would interpolate to observe that no such restructure of any existing employment relationship of relevance took place in the present context and care therefore needs to be taken in relation to any application to the principled approach there taken,EMPLOYMENT

it is also instructive to retrace the evolution of australian authority to drake personnel ltd v commissioner of state revenue vsca vr at in the context of a payroll tax dispute in which phillip ja said as follows all of this is very helpful here for it indicates that in a case like the present where a makes an agreement with b under which a supplies to b the services of c for the performance of work and a also makes a contract with c for c to perform the work for b it can be said readily enough that in performing the work c not only benefits b but is also advancing the business of a to the benefit of a it is true that the high court was considering a statutory definition serving to extend the concept of employment but it seems to me to follow that a temporary in accepting an engagement to perform work for drakes clients is doing the work as much for drake as for the client phillips ja referred to a number of authorities including stevens and at continued as follows in cases like these we are often instructed to stand well back to assess the situation after first having regard to the detailed facts,EMPLOYMENT
the issue here arising as to whether or not a contract of employment was mutually intended to be established between the applicants and cao was emphasised by the applicants in any event to fall for determination by the court objectively and in that regard at least largely by inference from the conduct of the relevant parties as exemplified in the following dicta of gaudron mchugh hayne and callinan jj appearing in ermogenous v greek orthodox community of sa inc hca clr at shortly after the high courts decision in hollis because the inquiry about this last aspect may take account of the subject matter of the agreement the status of the parties to it their relationship to one another and other surrounding circumstances not only is there obvious difficulty in formulating rules intended to prescribe the kinds of cases in which an intention to create contractual relations should or should not be found to exist it would be wrong to do so because the search for the intention to create contractual relations requires an objective assessment of the state of affairs between the parties the circumstances which might properly be taken into account in deciding whether there was the relevant intention are so varied as to preclude the formation of any prescriptive rules,EMPLOYMENT
in hollis v vabu pty limited hca clr at to which i was next referred by the applicants the need for caution in relying on earlier authorities relating to vicarious liability in tort for the purpose of determining the existence or otherwise of an employment relationship in a business or industrial setting appears at the threshold of the reasons for joint judgment of gleeson cj gaudron gummow kirby and hayne jj the circumstances of that case concerned a courier business involved in the delivery by couriers of articles on bicycles on the basis of payment of fixed rates for each assignment and in relation to which the high court established the existence of a relationship of employer and employee contrary to the decision below of the new south wales court of appeal,EMPLOYMENT
it was submitted by the applicants in the light of the foregoing authorities that in determining whether each of them is entitled to the relief sought in the present proceedings against cao it is necessary to consider the total relationship between the applicants and cao and hence all the facts and circumstances bearing upon the applicants particular employment in so doing it was further submitted that the court is entitled to have regard to conduct that occurred after the relationship commenced,EMPLOYMENT
specifically as to the importance of the notion of control the focus of that expression was said by cao to reside in the right of the putative employer to exercise the same with focus on ultimate authority over the employee as to the apparent origin of the judicial use of that latter expression cao invoked the observations made by the south australian full court in mason amp cox pty ltd v mccann sasr at where doyle cj said that emphasis is upon the importance of the legal right to control rather than the practical fact of control being an emphasis attributed to the following dictum of dixon j in humberstone v northern timber mills hca clr at the question is not whether in practice the work was in fact done subject to a direction and control exercised by an actual supervision or whether an actual supervision was possible but whether ultimate authority over the man in the performance of his work resided in the employer so that he was subject to the latters order and directions,EMPLOYMENT

specifically as to the importance of the notion of control the focus of that expression was said by cao to reside in the right of the putative employer to exercise the same with focus on ultimate authority over the employee as to the apparent origin of the judicial use of that latter expression cao invoked the observations made by the south australian full court in mason amp cox pty ltd v mccann sasr at where doyle cj said that emphasis is upon the importance of the legal right to control rather than the practical fact of control being an emphasis attributed to the following dictum of dixon j in humberstone v northern timber mills hca clr at the question is not whether in practice the work was in fact done subject to a direction and control exercised by an actual supervision or whether an actual supervision was possible but whether ultimate authority over the man in the performance of his work resided in the employer so that he was subject to the latters order and directions,EMPLOYMENT
further submissions in writing of the applicants in chief designated as the contract between applicants and respondent and comprising pages were placed before the court purportedly as conclusions those submissions commenced with an acknowledgment of the applicants that in so far as matters relating to the employment arrangements of the applicants were in writing they mainly suggest employment by mes rather than cao given particularly that the applicants were paid by mes and mes also made provision for superannuation workers compensation and deducted and remitted income tax payments to the australian taxation office,EMPLOYMENT
cao submitted additionally that the evidence did not support a conclusion other than that the ultimate legal control over each of the applicants resided with mes and further that although cao could forbid the applicants to enter the mine and could restrict their movement on the mine site that situation was no different from what applied to any person present on the mine site or seeking to enter the mine site moreover cao emphasised that the factor of control was only one factor to be considered in assessing the existence of an employment relationship and was not a determinative factor i was referred in that regard to act visiting medical officers at and,EMPLOYMENT
in any event it was submitted by cao that it is well established that a worker may be subject to quite detailed control over what they do and how they do it yet still not be an employee i was referred to ready mixed concrete ltd v minister of pensions and national insurance qb at where mackenna j observed in relation to the services undertaken by certain ownerdrivers engaged in the cartage of concrete by their own vehicles that a man does not cease to run a business on his own account because he agrees to run it efficiently or to accept anothers superintendence,EMPLOYMENT

the opinion of munby j at was therefore that i f the obligation to remunerate the worker is imposed on the agency there cannot be a contract of service between the worker and the enduser and conversely if at the same time control is vested in the enduser then there equally cannot be a contract of service between the worker and the agency those propositions were considered by his lordship to reflect a consistent line of authority holding that in such circumstances there is no contract of employment indeed no contract at all between the worker and the enduser,EMPLOYMENT
the applicants cited a number of authorities bearing upon the principles for determination of the existence or otherwise of an employment relationship the first was the dicta of wilson and dawson jj in stevens v brodribb sawmilling company proprietary limited hca clr at the immediate context there being an issue as to the vicarious liability in tort of a sawmiller for its independent contractors as distinct from its employees the other indicia of the nature of the relationship have been variously stated and have been added to from time to time,EMPLOYMENT
cao submitted that in substance and reality the applicants entered into a contract with and were each employed by mes and their attendance at the hvo to perform work pursuant to that contract involved no distinct offer of employment by cao nor an acceptance of such employment by the applicants cao referred by way of analogy to swift placements pty limited v workcover authority of new south wales ir at where the following appears in the judgment of the full court of the industrial relations commission of new south wales in court session,EMPLOYMENT
generally as to the significance of the extent of direction and control of the applicants exercised by cao the applicants submitted that the court was requested to look at all of the circumstances of the employment relationship and in particular whether the label given to it reflects the reality as well as the significance of the control test in any analysis of the employment relationship cao pointed however to the need to bear in mind that the contexts of the judicial observations for instance in the queen v foster ex parte commonwealth life assurances limited hca clr at and dalgety farmers were not related to labour hire arrangements contrary of course to the situation here,EMPLOYMENT
counsel for the applicants next drew attention to the more recent case in england of viasystems ltd v thermal transfer ltd and others qb as support for a different approach depending on time and integration on the worksite albeit in the context of vicarious liability in the light of what was there postulated by lord justice rix at on the theme of practical and structural considerations in relation to the engagement by a temporary employer of a person who might still be recognisable as the employee of his general employer his lordship expressed the following views at one is looking therefore for practical and structural considerations,EMPLOYMENT

in dealing with a situation where there was an award underpinning an individual contract of employment brennan cj dawson and toohey jj said in byrne v australian airlines limited hca clr at in a system of industrial regulation where some but not all of the incidents of an employment relationship are determined by award it is plainly unnecessary that the contract of employment should provide for those matters already covered by the award the contract may provide additional benefits but cannot derogate from the terms and conditions imposed by the award and the award operates with statutory force to secure those terms and conditions,EMPLOYMENT

the second issue arose because at of the reasons in rubibi no i raised the question of whether the determination should limit the exploitation of the resources in the yawuru claim area to noncommercial exploitation the yawuru claimants opposed any such limitation and contended that that limitation would be inconsistent with their right to exclusive possession which they claimed entitled the native title holders to determine the purposes for which the land and waters were to be used,PROPERTY
the state contended that the native title rights and interests claimed and pursued at trial by the yawuru claimants did not include any right of commercial exploitation of the resources of the land or waters the state pointed out that in relation to a claim under the nta the court is not concerned with the common law rights that might attach to a right of exclusive possession but rather with the native title rights and interests possessed under traditional laws and customs see members of the yorta yorta aboriginal community v state of victoria hca clr at and de rose v state of south australia fcafc fcr at,PROPERTY

the commonwealth made submissions on this issue because two of the freeholds in question are held by the aboriginal and torres strait islander commission in the course of the commonwealths submissions it became apparent that the freehold grants were in the cable beach area and probably had houses constructed upon them by the freehold grantees or by purchasers from those grantees who had not been informed of these proceedings or of the likelihood that their rights were subject to the rights and interests of the native title holders,PROPERTY
the law applicable to a challenge to the validity of a regulation made in the exercise of a statutory power to make regulations would appear to be applicable to the analogous exercise of a power to reserve land for certain purposes under a regulation that provides for the exercise of that power in south australia v tanner hca clr at brennan j stated that as the validity of a regulation depends on whether it answers the statutory description the problem is one of characterisation,PROPERTY
it can be accepted that the phrase public purposes has a broad meaning in bathurst city council v pwc properties pty ltd hca clr at gaudron mchugh gummow hayne and callinan jj stated that the phrase public purposes connotes the giving to the public of some rights in the land which subtract from the crowns full ownership,PROPERTY
further in the majority judgment in western australia v ward hca clr at their honours observed reservation of land under the relevant western australian provisions inhibited the crowns future action in relation to that land,PROPERTY
the yawuru claimants did not contest the extinguishment claimed in respect of the areas on which the gaol and the police station have been constructed as i later explain it is common ground that extinguishment has occurred in any event in respect of those areas because the gaol and police station are public works,CRIMINAL
there remains the question of whether by constructing a gaol and a police station on the reserves the crown created in others or asserted rights in relation to the land that were inconsistent with native title rights and interests over the land see in ward hc in my view the exercise of the right to construct a gaol or police station on part only of the reserved land is not necessarily inconsistent with native title rights and interests in the remaining part of the reserved land if that part of the reserve is not reasonably necessary for or incidental to the operation or enjoyment of the gaol or police station cf de rose v south australia fcafc fcr at and,PROPERTY
the issue on which the yawuru claimants and the state differed concerned whether the native title right and interest to live on the leased land was inconsistent with the rights conferred by the pastoral or mining leases the state accepted that i was bound by the decision of the full court in northern territory of australia v alyawarr kaytetye warumungu wakaya native title claim group fcafc fcr at to find that the native title right to live on a pastoral lease is not inconsistent with the rights of the lessee under the lease,PROPERTY

in hayes v northern territory fca fcr at olney j pointed out that given the context in which s b was enacted clr the requirement for occupation of the land should be understood in the sense that the indigenous people had traditionally occupied the land rather than in the sense of occupation according to common law principles his honour then stated at the use of traditional country by members of the relevant claimant group which is neither random nor coincidental but in accordance with the way of life habits customs and usages of the group is in the context of the legislation sufficient to indicate occupation of the land,PROPERTY
if settlements do not occur and native title claims have to be resolved in an adversarial proceeding there remains the risk for the claimant community that native title may prove to be yet another of the prospects held out to indigenous communities where the realisable gain falls short of that originally expected as a result of the decision in mabo v queensland hca clr however if compromises are able to be achieved the cause of reconciliation between australias past and present will be greatly advanced and the economic social and educational benefits available to all australians may be better able to be accessed by members of claimant communities,PROPERTY

lend lease therefore invoked the principle that since the fpa constituted a contract for the future sale of the westpac shares whereby until the effectuation of that sale ownership would remain with lend lease and not pass to county natwest there was not acquired by natwest any beneficial interest in the westpac shares prior to completion of the fpa as scheduled to occur on the completion date stipulated by the fpa for april subject to the proviso of that contractual definition namely unless it is adjusted under clause or i was referred by lend lease to associated alloys pty ltd v acn pty limited hca clr at where recognition was afforded by the majority judgment of the high court to the principle that effect should be given to any expression of intention of the parties to a contract for the sale of goods concerning the retention of ownership in favour of the seller until the goods were fully paid for by the buyer,PROPERTY

lend lease submitted accordingly that the imposition of what it portrayed as the attempted double taxation of an asset on the part of the commissioner implicitly by reference to lend leases derivation of dividend income irrespective of its rebateable character would be an incongruous result and capricious or irrational and further that where an interpretation of legislation is reasonably open which does not lead to any such result and accords moreover with the evident purpose of the legislation that interpretation should be preferred by the court lend lease cited in that regard cooper brookes pty ltd v commissioner of taxation hca clr at where in the joint judgment of mason and wilson jj the following appears generally speaking mere inconvenience of result in itself is not a ground for departing from the natural and ordinary sense of the language read in its context,PROPERTY

by way of elaboration of the commissioners submissions relating to the theme framed by the commissioner as to how did lend lease regard the rights conferred in its favour by the fpa it was pointed out that the lend lease internal documentation disclosed that lend lease was desirous of disposing of a significant proportion of its holding in westpac though obviously it would not dispose of assets to an arms length party at less than market value especially not for in plus cent in when the market price on the contract date was however as i have earlier emphasised lend lease remained entitled to receive the dividend income to be derived in the meantime on its ongoing holding of its westpac portfolio,PROPERTY
upon the topic of the right of a taxpayer as to the benefit of offsetting of capital losses the commissioner submitted that it was incorrect of lend lease to characterise that right as one which lend lease agreed to relinquish on completion of the fpa and further that what was constituted by the fpa in favour of lend lease was rather a right which was partly discharged each time a dividend was received the commissioner purportedly invoking in that regard the operation of s m of the tax act which reads as follows m a change shall be taken to have occurred in the ownership of an asset by in the case of an asset being a debt a chose in action or any other right or an interest or right in or over property the cancellation release discharge satisfaction surrender forfeiture expiry or abandonment at law or in equity of the asset it was therefore submitted by the commissioner that no capital loss arose from the partial discharge of the relevant rights since the cost base of the part of each of the rights disposed of on each occasion was offset by the amount of the dividend received,PROPERTY
specifically as to the s za issue the commissioner submitted to be flawed an alternative proposition that the lend lease case to the effect that the capital gain on disposal of the westpac shares was to be disregarded under what it described controversially as the antioverlap provisions of that subsection for the following reasons it could not be said rightly that dividends would be included in assessable income as a result of the disposal of the asset here being of course the westpac shares because inclusion in the taxable income resulted from the later circumstance that payments were in fact received from westpac once received so the submission continued those payments were said by the commissioner properly to be characterised under the income tax provisions as assessable income however the dividends declared and paid by westpac to lend lease at the material times were said by the commissioner not to be included in lend leases income as a result of the disposal of the asset within the meaning of s za as at the date of disposal of the westpac shares it could not have been said that any amount will be included in assessable income of lend lease since there is no certainty that dividends will be paid in the future depending as dividends do on availability of distributable profits and discretion of the board of directors and moreover until a dividend is declared any such declaration can only be in the eye of the law a possibility only norman v federal commissioner of taxation hca clr at the commissioner criticised what was described by lend lease as the transaction having constituted one of mere deferred delivery for a discounted purchase price for the reason that the description was merely a beguiling oversimplification and as not in any event reflective of the case propounded by lend lease,PROPERTY
the commissioner further submitted that the parties have clearly intended lend leases contractual rights to be assignable in the light of clause of the fpa moreover i was referred by the commissioner to clause of the fpa headed no merger which stipulates as follows the rights and obligations of the parties will not merge on completion of any transaction under the fpa,PROPERTY

report did not explain what if anything was identified as a factor that had been eliminated from consideration it is not possible to read this finding as another way of stating that the ceo or the minister had not attributed for the purposes of s tae any injury or threat of injury to qenos to factors other than the exportation of goods from thailand or by siam,PROPERTY
am of opinion that reading report as a whole and making allowance for any looseness in language or unhappy phrasing it does not contain any practical analysis or reasoning process by the ceo or the minister of what if any injury was threatened on the balance of probabilities if siam continued to export the product to australia at the dumped prices it was not enough for the ceo and the minister merely to recite a paraphrase of the test in s tae but discard it,CRIMINAL
other reason supported the conclusion that the threat of material injury to qenos would be caused by siams dumping alone if the measures were allowed to expire the material in report was inadequate to establish that the ceo and the minister had considered what was shown in confidential appendix as undercutting in accordance with s tae by not attributing any factor other than dumping as being likely to cause material injury,CRIMINAL
respondents contended that it was open to the ceo to make the finding in report that in that context it was likely that there would be price convergence between siams imports and qenos product they argued that the test of causation of material injury was essentially a practical exercise that had the purpose of achieving an objective of determining whether viewed as a whole the relevant australian industry is suffering material injury from dumping relying on what lockhart j had said in swan portland cement ltd v minister for small business and customs fca fcr at and schaefer waste technology sdn bhd v chief executive officer australian customs service fca fcr at per jacobson j,PROPERTY

argued that the reasoning in report recording the ceos satisfaction as to the matters set out in s zhf was the product of hypothesising about the impact of unknown and undefined future events that bore no causal relationship to the expiry of the measures siam contended that the conclusions in report that the expiration of the measures would lead or be likely to lead to the occurrence or recurrence of both dumping and material injury and particularly the likelihood of dumping causing or threatening material injury were not sufficiently causally connected in a reasoning process in the report to justify the decision to continue the measures against siam,CRIMINAL

on june the union filed an application in the australian industrial relations commission pursuant to s of the workplace relations act the university was the respondent to that application,EMPLOYMENT
the foregoing brief survey of provisions in the workplace relations act relevant to the making and coming into operation of the collective agreement serves to remind that such an agreement is not a mere matter of private contract more particularly given that the acknowledged breaches arise against the background of action taken by the university in response to unforseen and it seems unforeseeable events having profound financial ramifications it makes particularly apposite the following observations made by keely j in lynch v buckley sawmills pty ltd fca fcr at in this connection it is important that the respondent and other employers bound by the award or by the other awards under the act understand the importance of complying with an award and it follows that any decision taken by them which is regarded as affecting their obligations to comply with particular provisions of an award or the award generally should only be taken after careful consideration,EMPLOYMENT
while his honours remarks were addressed to the terms of an industrial award and those bound by an award they are just as applicable to the terms of a collective agreement which has come into operation per force of the workplace relations act and to those bound by such an agreement when the terms of a collective agreement come into operation per force of statute they become part of the law of the land and must be obeyed by all of those bound by the agreement see by analogy electrical trades union of australia v sims products ltd trading as besco batteries ir at per gray j,EMPLOYMENT

neither the union nor the university submitted that there were any directly applicable comparative sentences a position confirmed by my own researches it is true as branson j noted in construction forestry mining and energy union v coal and allied operations pty ltd ir at in respect of a materially similar earlier penalty regime that the workplace relations act does not give any explicit guidance as to the circumstances in which an order imposing penalty will be appropriate or as to the circumstances in which a penalty of or near the maximum or alternatively of a lesser amount will be warranted,EMPLOYMENT
